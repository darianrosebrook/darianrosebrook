## About me

I have worked as a consultant and contractor on multiple branding and user experience projects. I have found that both compliment each other, like two halves of a company. Making sure that the people have a good experience is good branding, and having good branding can lead to great experiences.

I write and teach designers how to build better design processes and focus on helping the community as a whole get better by helping designers understand business.

Most recently, I've been helping the Microsoft Edge team work on improving the Developer Experiences of our developer tools and scaling  the internal Product Design Process.

As a designer, I am adept at handling both the user experience of digital products and the brand experience of a product's design ecosystem.

I couldn't find a better way to marry the skills I learned as a UX designer and my passion for creating meaningful brand experiences both on and off screens.
