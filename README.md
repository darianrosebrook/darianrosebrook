## Hey there, I'm Darian 👋🏼 

### Staff Design Technologist · Design Systems Thinker · Creating custom tools for Designers and Developers

Over the past decade, I’ve helped teams at eBay, Microsoft, Nike, Venmo, and others solve large-scale design system and product design challenges. My work bridges the gap between design and engineering—with a focus on building scalable systems, developer/designer tooling, and interaction-rich experiences that teach as much as they execute.

Lately, I’ve been creating tools and documentation to help teams think more clearly about their systems—from design tokens to typography anatomy to Radix-style component libraries across Web, iOS, and Android. I believe design systems should not only scale, but teach—and that documentation should be interactive, accessible, and deeply composable.

I’m not actively job seeking, but I’m always excited to connect with folks working on challenging design infrastructure, interaction design tooling, or cross-functional education. If you're solving deep product or systems problems and need someone who designs with engineers and codes with designers—I’m your person.

## What I Focus On  

* **Cross-Platform Design Systems Architecture**
  Helping teams build resilient design foundations that scale across Web, iOS, and Android with consistency and flexibility.

* **Design-to-Code Pipelines and Token Synchronization**
  Automating the connection between design and engineering through token sync tools, implementation-ready component libraries, and developer-aligned design specs.

* **Tooling that Empowers, Not Just Enables**
  Building plugins, internal tools, and interaction models that reduce friction *and* teach the thinking behind the system.

* **Interactive Documentation and Blueprint-Based Learning**
  Designing documentation experiences that grow with your team—replacing static specs with hands-on guidance, visual scaffolds, and in-context insights.

* **Accessibility, Color Contrast, and Type Fidelity**
  Working at the intersection of aesthetics and inclusivity—leveraging modern models like APCA, variable fonts, and type tooling to create accessible, expressive systems.

* **Typographic Tooling and Visual Infrastructure**
  Developing canvas-based inspection tools and font metric analyzers to help designers and developers reason about type anatomy with clarity.

* **Mentorship Through Systems and Language**
  Whether through writing, plugins, or pattern documentation, I aim to build systems that coach and scale shared understanding.

## Highlights

* **Cut implementation times from weeks to hours**
  Built tools at eBay and Nike that connected design and engineering, reducing component release time by over 90% and eliminating key friction in naming, theming, and token sync.

* **Created and scaled foundational libraries**
  Co-led Nike’s Podium Foundations Library and eBay’s token/component architecture, feeding multiple teams across enterprise and consumer-facing products.

* **Built dashboards that reveal the health of your design system**
  At Verizon, I designed and built a real-time analytics platform for Figma and GitLab that helped design leadership monitor adoption, gaps, and investment priorities across the organization.

* **Taught systems through tools**
  Developed plugins like “Designer’s Definition of Done” and interactive component blueprints that guide designers *as they work*, raising system literacy and confidence across teams.

* **Improved developer tooling UX for Microsoft Edge**
  Created debugging tools for web developers, including 3D DOM inspection and font diagnostic features, helping elevate Edge's utility for a core technical audience.

* **Led from within cross-functional squads**
  I don’t just “hand off” to devs—I embed, align, and scale. My hybrid background allows me to function as both product designer and design systems engineer, depending on what’s needed most.

* **Recognized voice in design education and community**
  Through podcasts, long-form articles, and design communities, I’ve mentored, taught, and influenced thousands of designers navigating the transition to systems thinking and design ops roles.
